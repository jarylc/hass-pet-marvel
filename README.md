## Troubleshooting Tips / Known Issues

When you discover that the mobile app is starting over and over, beginning again with the login steps, then you should use this HA integration with a different account than with the app. Create a second account and use the share function in the app - simply share the device with the second account
2. Power-cycle the litterbox
3. Reset the litterbox and re-integrate it
4. Open an issue
